# Washington-DC-real-time-bus-tracking
This is a simple WebGIS application I developed for a course project. It fetches real-time bus location data from WMATA API and displays it on the map. Users are able to enter
a bus route (or leave it blank for all routes) and choose a refreshing time interval to display markers representing buses. Users can also click on the markers for details 
of bus route. The application was developed and supported using Leaflet (Javascript). You can be access it here: https://chengbiliu.github.io/bus/index.html
